    Back in the COVID time, I thought of setting up a home theater. Two names kept popping up
    everywhere: <strong>Dolby</strong> and <strong>DTS</strong>. Both companies rule the cinema
    and home theater world, but at that time I had zero clue what the differences were.
    So I started researching, and here’s what I found — mixed with a little bit of my own experience.
  </p>

  <h4 class="h4 timeline-item-title">The early days</h4>
  <p class="timeline-text">
    Dolby’s journey began with <em>Dolby Stereo</em> in the late 70s. By the 90s,
    we got <strong>Dolby Digital (AC-3)</strong>. This was the first digital lossy surround
    sound that became standard on DVDs. I still remember our old DVD player proudly
    showing the Dolby Digital logo. It could do <strong>5.1 surround</strong>,
    usually at bitrates around 384–640 kbps.
  </p>
  <p class="timeline-text">
    DTS had its own equivalent: simply <strong>DTS 5.1 Core</strong>.
    It did the same thing but at higher bitrates — 768 kbps up to 1.5 Mbps.
    Many people said DTS sounded clearer, and technically it was, but I never
    experienced it back then. Our home setup was stuck with Dolby Digital.
  </p>

  <h4 class="h4 timeline-item-title">The Blu-ray era</h4>
  <p class="timeline-text">
    Then came the Blu-ray and the PlayStation 3 generation. Dolby upgraded to
    <strong>Dolby Digital Plus (DD+)</strong>. This was more efficient than the old Dolby Digital,
    able to scale up to ~1 Mbps, and even carry extra metadata for things like Atmos later on.
  </p>
  <p class="timeline-text">
    DTS countered with <strong>DTS-HD High Resolution</strong>, which was their
    lossy “HD” format. It could go as high as 6 Mbps — much higher than Dolby Digital Plus.
    Again, in theory it was better, but in practice I never got to hear it.
  </p>

  <h4 class="h4 timeline-item-title">Lossless sound — TrueHD vs DTS-HD Master</h4>
  <p class="timeline-text">
    Blu-ray also brought the ultimate tier: <strong>Dolby TrueHD</strong>,
    a <em>lossless codec</em> with up to 7.1 channels and bitrates around 18 Mbps.
    This was studio-master quality, no compression artifacts.
  </p>
  <p class="timeline-text">
    DTS answered with <strong>DTS-HD Master Audio</strong>, also lossless,
    running even higher, up to 24.5 Mbps. Both were amazing on paper.
    If you had the right receiver and speakers, this was the real deal.
  </p>

  <h4 class="h4 timeline-item-title">Atmos vs DTS:X</h4>
  <p class="timeline-text">
    By the mid-2010s, surround wasn’t enough anymore. Dolby launched
    <strong>Dolby Atmos</strong> in cinemas (2012) and later at home. Instead of just
    fixed channels, Atmos uses <em>objects</em> that can move in 3D space —
    over your head, around you, wherever the sound designer wants.
  </p>
  <p class="timeline-text">
    DTS replied with <strong>DTS:X</strong> in 2015. It’s also object-based
    and flexible, scaling to whatever speaker layout you have.
    The problem is content. While Dolby Atmos is everywhere — Blu-ray, Apple TV,
    Netflix, Disney+ — DTS:X is still rare, and often requires renting or
    buying discs through special services.
  </p>

  <h4 class="h4 timeline-item-title">Wrapping up</h4>
  <p class="timeline-text">
    The main reason I stuck with Dolby is simple: when I heard that Apple Music was
    going to support <strong>Dolby Atmos</strong> and <strong>Lossless Audio</strong>, I was sold.
    A streaming service, at a cheap price, letting you enjoy music in Atmos —
    it really gives that magic and butterflies. This was enough for me to fully
    embrace Dolby in my setup.
  </p>
  <p class="timeline-text">
    Someday, I do want to set up a <strong>DTS:X system</strong> and experience it myself.
    I’ve heard from audiophiles and movie lovers that it’s wild and amazing.
    For now though, it isn’t practical for me. But maybe in the future — fingers crossed —
    I’ll get the chance. Until then, Dolby has been more than enough, and it hasn’t
    disappointed me one bit.
