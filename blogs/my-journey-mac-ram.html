      My first real Mac moment was with a <strong>mid-2012 MacBook Pro</strong>. Upgrading from <strong>8&nbsp;GB</strong> to <strong>16&nbsp;GB</strong> felt like a single-click job: back cover off, two sticks in, done. No drama, just instant speed.
    </p>
  
    <p class="timeline-text">
      Then the design trend hit: thinner, sleeker. Around <strong>2016</strong>, the MacBook Pro got slimmer and Apple started <em>tightening</em> things—RAM and SSD went from slots to solder. Sad reality: flexibility out, aesthetics in.
    </p>
  
    <p class="timeline-text">
      With the <strong>M-series era (2020s)</strong>, everything became unified and non-swappable. I’m now on a <strong>MacBook Air M4 with 32&nbsp;GB unified memory</strong>. You choose once, and you’re locked. Storage is the same story. Sure, you can run macOS from an external SSD formatted APFS, but it’ll never feel as native as storage on the logic board (aka “motherboard” for the rest of us).
    </p>
  
    <p class="timeline-text">
      I still wish that, just like the EU’s push for replaceable batteries, we’d get <em>replaceable RAM and storage</em> back. Meanwhile, Apple’s upgrade pricing stings—think <strong>~€200 for a RAM bump</strong> and <strong>~€1,800–€2,000 for big SSD jumps</strong>—even though consumer SSDs are pretty affordable nowadays.

    <ul class="service-list">
  
      <li class="service-item">
        <div class="service-content-box">
          <h4 class="h4 service-item-title">Wired Memory</h4>
          <p class="service-item-text">
            Reserved for the macOS kernel, drivers, and low-level services. It’s “pinned”: <em>can’t move, can’t compress</em>. On a 32&nbsp;GB machine, a few GB (e.g., 3–4&nbsp;GB) here is normal.
          </p>

      <li class="service-item">
        <div class="service-content-box">
          <h4 class="h4 service-item-title">Compressed Memory</h4>
          <p class="service-item-text">
            When RAM pressure rises, macOS <em>losslessly</em> shrinks inactive pages in place (e.g., 5&nbsp;GB → 2.5&nbsp;GB). It stays in RAM and is decompressed instantly when touched again—faster than hitting disk.
          </p>

      <li class="service-item">
        <div class="service-content-box">
          <h4 class="h4 service-item-title">App Memory</h4>
          <p class="service-item-text">
            What your apps, tabs, background tasks, and services actively use. It grows and shrinks with your workload; close heavy apps to relieve pressure quickly.
          </p>

      <li class="service-item">
        <div class="service-content-box">
          <h4 class="h4 service-item-title">Swap Memory</h4>
          <p class="service-item-text">
            Overflow to SSD when compression isn’t enough. It can grow up to available SSD space, but it’s slower and adds write wear—so macOS prefers compression first.

          <h4 class="h4 service-item-title">“Moore’s Law” (in one line)</h4>
          <p class="service-item-text">
            Historically, the number of transistors on chips roughly doubled every ~2 years, driving <em>more performance per cost</em> over time. That trend makes consumers expect parts to get cheaper or more capable regularly.

    </ul>
  
    <p class="timeline-text">
      But even if tech gets denser, Apple’s upgrades remain premium-priced—and once you pick RAM or SSD on an M-series Mac, that configuration is <em>forever</em>. It’s not the same old days of popping in new sticks, but with 32&nbsp;GB and smart compression, the day-to-day stays smooth.
